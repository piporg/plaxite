            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Julius Müller.
                I study mechatronics engineering at the Hochschule Ruhr West in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany.
                Since my childhood, I tinker in my freetime.
                I started with electronics.
                Later I did some very advanced woodworking, I was very lucky about being allowed to use the workshop at
                the company I worked for my hobby projects.<br>
                One of my most advanced projects was a digital organ with three selfmade wooden keyboards.
                I also did the electronics inside myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since a few years, I focus on computer science.
                And I always try to find some projects that combine technology with artistic creativity.
                I build a lot stuff for my work with teenagers.<br>
                I'm also envolved in a theater club where I do cool stuff with light.
                My last project was to automate everything.
                During the live show, the operator only has a text book on a screen with buttons embedded to it.
                When pushing on these, microphones automatically turn on and off, music plays and the scene's light show
                starts.
                It runs on a Raspberry Pi that autostarts the software, so no clicky clicky to set things up on venue.
                The best thing about this project is that it bases on a single text file, which contains the text book
                and defines where which soundfile should be played etc.
                And in the unlikely case of failure, the operator is still able to intervene, because the software only
                remote controles the light and audio mixer and doesn't substitute these.
            </p>
