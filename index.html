            <h2>The winner takes it all!</h2>
            <p>
                Good news! I won this year's
                <a href="https://www.hochschule-ruhr-west.de/die-hrw/news/details/ideenwettbewerb-2022/">
                    HRW Ideenwettbewerb
                </a>.
                The prize money helped me buying material.
                I am currently building the first prototype and really enjoy working on it!

            <h2>plax... What?</h2>
            <p>The word <b>plaxite</b> is composed of the words <b>plain</b> and <b>excite</b>.
                And that is the idea behind the product.
                Excite your audience with your plain scenery.</p>

        <div class="contentbox">
            <h2>So what's the problem?</h2>
            <p>
                Amateur theaters as well as small commercial theaters often don't have the budget to build complex
                scenery.
                Particularly if they don't have their own stage and go on tour instead.<br>
                To reduce cost, load and storage room, they have to build plain and ideally reusable stage sets.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="contentbox right">
            <h2>Sounds cool? But how?</h2>
            <p>
                plaxite lets you use simple objects like <b>planes</b>, <b>boxes</b>, <b>cylinders</b> or <b>spheres</b>
                as
                stage props.
                The system tracks these and projects any texture you want on them. If an actor takes it and moves
                it,
                the projection follows the object.
                Even if the object is rotated, the projection's perspective will be skewed.
                You can also use multiple objects at the same time.

            <h2>Is it expensive High Tech?</h2>
            <p>
                No, it isn't!
                The software runs in a web browser, so you can use any device you have.
                Of course, the tracking speed is dependent on the device, but tracking a flying object in the air is not
                our
                goal anyway.
                You also need a camera and at least one projector.
                If you use two, you can project from two different angles to reduce shadows.
                And you need these planes, boxes etc.

            <h2>Is it difficult to use?</h2>
            <p>
                Glad you ask!
                Along with being inexpensive, the main focus is on being simple.
                Most small theaters can't hire a computer scientist.<br>
                Setting up a show is scene based.
                For each object, you define graphics to be projected on it in each scene.
                plaxite provides templates with unwrapped objects.
                Looks like you want to fold a cube out of a single sheet of paper.
                You can then paint these with any graphicssoftware you like and import them to plaxite.
                If you want, you can print these, draw on them by hand and scan them afterwards.
                And if you have some video editing skills, you can create videos to project on the objects using the
                same
                two-dimensional template.

            <h2>How to operate it live?</h2>
            <p>
                It's not a big deal.
                Just call the scenes you set up earlier with your light mixer via the standard DMX protocol. From the
                light
                operator's perspective, plaxite can be integrated to a light show like any other DMX controlled fixture.

                Well... be patient. plaxite is the topic of my bachelor thesis. So this may take a while.
